# Lab Activity: PostgreSQL Query Optimization

**Objective:** This activity will test your ability to analyze, diagnose, and optimize slow SQL queries in a PostgreSQL environment. You will use your knowledge of `EXPLAIN`, indexing strategies, and query rewriting to improve the performance of a sample application.

**Scenario:** You are a database administrator tasked with improving the performance of a new blog platform. The initial schema was written for MySQL, and developers have reported that several key features are becoming slow as more data is added. Your job is to prepare the database for production.

The database will be populated with a large dataset:
*   `authors`: ~500 records (authors.sql)
*   `posts`: ~10,000 records (posts.sql)

---

## Part 1: Schema Migration and Setup

Your first task is to prepare the database schema and load the data.

### 1.1. Convert MySQL Schema to PostgreSQL

The initial schema is provided in `schema.sql`. This file uses MySQL-specific syntax.

**Task:**
1.  Create a new SQL file named `schema_postgres.sql`.
2.  Copy the contents of `schema.sql` into it.
3.  Modify the DDL statements in `schema_postgres.sql` to be fully compatible with PostgreSQL.
4.  **Add a Foreign Key:** The original schema is missing a critical relationship constraint. Add a foreign key constraint to the `posts` table that links `author_id` to the `id` in the `authors` table.

### 1.2. Load the Data

**Task:**
1.  Execute your `schema_postgres.sql` script in your PostgreSQL database to create the tables.
2.  Import the data from `authors.sql` and `posts.sql` into the respective tables.

## Part 2: Query Analysis and Optimization

For each scenario below, you must:
1.  Run the provided query with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
2.  Capture the execution plan and the total execution time.
3.  In your analysis, identify the bottleneck (e.g., `Seq Scan` on a large table) and explain *why* the query is inefficient.
4.  Propose and implement a fix. This will typically involve creating an index or rewriting the query to be S-ARGable.
5.  Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the *optimized* query to verify the improvement.
6.  Compare the "before" and "after" execution times and plans to demonstrate the success of your optimization.

### Scenario 1: The Slow Author Profile Page

A user's (pick 1 author) profile page needs to display all their posts (id and title), with the most recent ones first.

**Query:**
```sql
--- Provide the query
```

**Analysis Questions:**
*   What is the primary node causing the slowness in the initial execution plan?
*   How can you optimize both the `WHERE` clause filtering and the `ORDER BY` operation with a single change?
*   Implement your fix and record the new plan. How much faster is the query now?

### Scenario 2: The Unsearchable Blog

The website needs a feature to search for posts by a keyword in the title using a "contains" search (e.g., `'%database%'`).

**Query:**
```sql
--- Provide the query
```

**Analysis Questions:**
*   First, try adding a standard B-Tree index on the `title` column. Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` again. Did the planner use your index? Why or why not?
*   The business team agrees that searching by a *prefix* is acceptable for the first version. Rewrite the query to use a prefix search (e.g., `database%`).
*   Does the index work for the prefix-style query? Explain the difference in the execution plan.
*   (Bonus) What feature in PostgreSQL is designed to handle "full-text search" like the original `'%keyword%'` requirement more efficiently?

### Scenario 3: The Monthly Performance Report

An internal dashboard needs to pull all posts published in a specific January 2015. 

**Query:**
```sql
--- Provide a non-sargable query. (e.g.: use EXTRACT function to extract month and year)
```

**Analysis Questions:**
*   This query is not S-ARGable. What does that mean in the context of this query? Why can't the query planner use a simple index on the `date` column effectively?
*   Rewrite the query to use a direct date range comparison, making it S-ARGable.
*   Create an appropriate index to support your rewritten query.
*   Compare the performance of the original query and your optimized version.

### Scenario 4: The Author Email Lookup

The system frequently needs to look up an author's details using their unique email address. 

**Query:**
```sql
--- Provide the query for looking up an author by email
```

**Analysis Questions:**
*   When you migrated the schema, did you include a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `email` column in the `authors` table?
*   Run `\d authors` in `psql` to inspect the table's structure. Does an index on the `email` column already exist? If so, where did it come from?
*   If an index does not exist, what is the performance of the lookup query? What would you do to fix it?

## Part 3: Submission and Rubric (20 Points Total)

Please submit the following:

1.  Your final `schema_postgres.sql` file.
2.  A separate SQL file named `indexes.sql` containing all the `CREATE INDEX` statements you used to optimize the queries.
3.  A Markdown document containing your analysis for each of the four scenarios. This document must include:
    *   The "before" and "after" execution plans from `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
    *   The "before" and "after" query execution times.
    *   The provided queries for each scenario with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    *   Your answers to the analysis questions for each scenario.
