Another git workflow:
1. Create GitHub repo
2. Copy GitHub repo link
3. Open terminal
4. Go to Documents directory [cd Documents]
5. Clone remote repo [git clone <link>]
6. Open local repo with vscode [code repo-folder]
7. Enjoy coding!



Frequent workflow when repo is existing already
and during every changes:
1. Update repo from remote [git pull origin main]
2. Stage [git add .] -> dot means all changes in current dir
3. Commit [git commit -m "commit message"]
Note: if first time, need to personalize repo with
git config user.email "email@lorma.edu"
git config user.name "username"
4. Push [git push -u origin main]

To logout: git credential-manager github logout username
